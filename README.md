# Encryption and Verification of Message

Client and server applications with confidential message exchange created in
and to provide authentication, integrity and key sharing among both the client
and server. 

Implemented the RSA algorithm from scratch that will be used for secret key
encryption and digital signature. 

For Message digest creation used existing hash algorithm compatible. 

Working of the secure system is be as follows :-
## How to run:-

- First run server.py
- Then run client.py
- Enter valid value of public and private key parameters of server.
- In client enter value of input and key in binary form ( ‘without 0b format’)(ex plain text:10010101 key:1010110)
- Then input client public and private key parameters.
